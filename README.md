git-ember-treetable
===================

July-August 2013. An ember approach to treetables that includes checkboxes (which cascade and bubble properly), 'Expand/Collapse all' functionality, and reveal a node (e.g. open all parents of a node) from outside the table.

NOTE: Code largely based on approach outlined by Sebastian Seilund at http://dev.billysbilling.com/blog/How-to-implement-a-tree-in-Ember-js
